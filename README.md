## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Use the scripts in `data_preprocessing/` to clean and prepare raw datasets.
   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing/clean_data.py --input raw_data.csv --output processed_data.csv
   ```

2. **Sequence Alignment**:
   Perform sequence alignment using tools in `alignment_tools/`.
   ```bash
   python alignment_tools/align_sequences.py --seq1 seq1.fasta --seq2 seq2.fasta
   ```

3. **Visualization**:
   Create interactive plots for your data:
   ```bash
   python visualization/create_plot.py --input processed_data.csv --output plot.png
   ```
